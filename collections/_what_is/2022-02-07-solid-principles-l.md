excerpt: SOLID is an acronym for several programming principles for object-orientated programming that aim to create understandable, readable, and testable code. L is the Liskov Substitution principle, which states that any child of a parent class should be able to replace it without breaking the program.

SOLID: an acronym for a collection of object-orientated programming principles, that aim to create understandable, readable, and testable code.

* S - Single Responsibility
* O - Open-Closed
* L - **Liskov Substitution**
* I - Interface Segregation
* D - Dependency Inversion

So this is a pretty simple principle. If we have one class that inherits another, then any interaction with a parent class should be exchangeable with the child without disrupting the program.

## The Example

Let's image that our mythical creature rental business (a common example in these little posts) has grown and now has many employees! We've created a simple HR platform to keep track of and report on our team. Neat.

```typescript
type Allergy = "dragons" | "unicorns" | "mermaid";

class Employee {
  private id: string;
  private allergies: Allergy[];

  constructor(employeeId: string, allergies: Allergy[]) {
    this.id = employeeId;
    this.allergies = allergies;
  }

  /**
    Talk to the salary service and fetch the employees salary.
  */
  async getSalary(): Promise<number> {
    return someSalaryService.getEmployeeSalary(this.id);
  }

  // You get the idea, there could be a lot more here...
}
```

Then in order to report on their salaries, we need some method to gather them:

```typescript
const getMonthlyCost = async (employees: Employee[]): Promise<number[]> => {
  const promises = employees.map((employee) => employee.getSalary() / 12);
  const salaries = await Promise.all(promises);
  return salaries;
}
```

Great! But we're growing really quickly and now need to take on some contractors. Their behaviour is a little different, as they are paid a daily rate.

```typescript
class Contractor extends Employee {
  async getSalary(): Promise<number> {
    throw new Error("Contractors do not get paid a salary");
  }

  async getDayRate(): Promise<number> {
    return someDayRateService.getContractorDayRate(this.id);
  }
}
```

But now if we pass a `Contractor` instance to our `getMonthlyCost` function, it will error! We've implemented a class that if we were to use in replacement for a parent, will no longer work. So how do we fix it? There's a few ways, but the simplest (and therefore arguably the best) is to tackle this problem by altering the interface to `Employee`.

```typescript
class Employee {
  constructor(private id: string, private allergies: Allergy[]) {
    this.id = id;
    this.allergies = allergies;
  }

  /**
    Talk to the salary service and fetch the employees salary.
  */
  async getMonthlyCost(): Promise<number> {
    return someSalaryService.getEmployeeSalary(this.id) / 12;
  }
}

class Contractor extends Employee {
  constructor(id: string, allergies: Allergy[], private daysWorked: number) {
    super(id, allergies);

    this.daysWorked = daysWorked;
  }

  async getMonthlyCost(): Promise<number> {
    const rate = await someContractorService.getContractorRate(this.id);
    return rate * this.daysWorked;
  }
}
```

Then our `getMonthlyCost` becomes:

```typescript
const getMonthlyCost = async (employees: Employee[]): Promise<number[]> => {
  const promises = employees.map((employee) => employee.getMonthlyCost());
  const salaries = await Promise.all(promises);
  return salaries;
}
```

Now if we were to introduce a new type of `Employee`, maybe one who doesn't work every other month, then we could implement the same interface and none of our downstream code would need to change! Huzzah!
