> tldr; a repository is an interface that controls access and mutation of a domain aggregate to some persistance layer. It's the middleman between the two.

Web frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) come with "batteries included". They do a lot of stuff straight out of the box without you needing to spend too much time thinking about about it, leaving you free to focus on problems that are more closely aligned to the reason you're working with them in the fist place. One of these is object access and persistence, Django's Models and Rails' Active Records are the APIs around which objects are defined and then stored.

But what if you can't, or even simply don't want to use them? Maybe you're learning a new tech which doesn't have this feature, maybe you're building your own framework, or maybe you're simply working in an environment that prohibits their use? (Squeezing a big web framework into a lambda is tricksy.) You'll sidestep the constraints that such frameworks impose, but you'll have to solve a lot of problems yourself, and one tool that might help with that, is the Repository.

## A simple blog...

Let's start with the basic example of what a blog might look like. Before we can begin any modelling we need to to have some notion as to what it actually is that we're modelling, and for that we'll use an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/what-is/repository/repository-blog-erd.jpg" alt="Entity relationship diagram for a simple blog." caption="An ERD of a simple blog. Posts can be have n tags to group them, and are written by a single author. This blog supports commenting on posts, which again can have a single author. (I'll probably do a more details post on ERDs soon.) " %}{: .img-zoom}

Lovely! So it's a pretty simple blog, there are posts, tags, comments and users. But nothing mentions the word **aggregate**. How do we know where to start? What even is it?

> A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. - [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html)

A great example of this is a shopping basket and items, where one adds and removes items from the basket. In this case it can be useful to think of the items in terms of the basket they're in, rather than the items themselves.

Generally deciding upon aggregates is an exercise in exploratory thinking, the answer may not be as obvious as it seems (and if if it _is_ obvious, you're probably better off doing the thinking anyway!). You can do this as a group, or spend time mulling it over with a coffee.

In our case then, what do we have? Well, arguably one aggregate and two stand alone domain objects. i.e. comments don't make much sense without a post, so perhaps they belong under a `Post` aggregate? Tags and users on the other hand seem like independent entities, so let's keep them like that.

### Brace yourself, there's some code coming...

Above we said the repository is a pattern for access and mutating domain aggregates, before we can really see how it works, we'll need to have an idea about the other objects in the domain.

```typescript
// where would the internet be without comments?
// (notably, this blog does not have comments... ðŸ‘€)
interface Comment {
  author: User;
  content: str;
}

// posts have a single author, and can have n tags or comments
interface Post {
  title: str;
  content: str;
  comments: Comment[];
  tags: Tag[];
  author: User;
}

// tags can be used to group posts together
interface Tag {
  name: str;
}

// a very simple user object
interface User {
  email: str;
  username: str;
}
```

Now are aware of our domain objects, let's quickly see what saving a comment to an relational database using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) might look like:

```typescript
// domain object
class Comment {
  author: User;
  content: str;
  post: Post;

  constructor (author: User, content: str, post: Post) {
    this.author = author;
    this.content = content;
    this.post = post;
  }

  async save(client: pg.Client) {
    // post_id and author_id are not foreign keys
    const text = `INSERT INTO comments(content, author_id, post_id) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)`;
    const values = [this.content. this.post.title, this.author.email];
    // probably want some error catching here
    await client.query(text, values)
  }
}

// app.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.post('/api/comment/', (req, res) => {
  const author = request.body.author;
  // having this code here just adds noise, you get the idea
  const post = new Post(...)
  const comment = new Comment(
    author,
    req.body.content,
    post
  )
  comment.save();

  res.send('""');
  res.status(201).end();
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App is listening at http://locahost${port}`)
});
```

To summarize the above, we have some API endpoint that we can do a POST request to, and it'll convert the body to domain objects and then save it. Easy.

So what's the issue here? Well part of the problem is that our domain object is doing a lot. There's a blurring of the boundaries between the domain layer and the data layer, but we're also relying on our persistence engine to **protect our state consistency**. What if the post gets deleted? Will comments be cleaned up too? That really just depends on the DB and its configuration, and if we need to change our DB for some reason, then what?

### Enter the repository

It's important to bring up a simple rule when working with aggregates and repositories. Each repository should reflect _one_ aggregate and no more. With that in mind, we might end up with something that looks like this:

```typescript
interface PostRepository {
  async save(post: Post) => void;
  async getPost(postId: string) => Promise<Post | undefined>;
  async getByTag(tag: Tag) => Promise<Post[]>;
  addComment(comment: Comment) => void;
}

interface TagRepository {
  async save(tag: Tag) => void;
  async getTag(name: string) => Promise<Tag | undefined>;
}

interface UserRepository {
  async save(user: User) => void;
  async getUser(email: string) => Promise<User | undefined>;
}
```

Great! Let's just focus on the interesting one, the `PostRepository`. If we're interacting with all grouped entities from the aggregate, how will we know what to do? How will we know what to save, update, or delete? We could figure it out at save time, but it's more more efficient to keep track of changes to the aggregate within the aggregate itself, and _then_ act on this.

```typescript
interface CommentEvent {
  type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'delete'
  id: string;
}

class Post {
  private events: CommentEvent[];

  constructor(...) {
    // set properties from constructor arguments (not doing so here because
    // it's a distraction)
    this.events = [];
  }

  addComment(comment): void {
    this.comments.push(comment);
    this.events.push({ type: 'add', id: comment.id });
  }

  getEvents(): CommentEvent[] {
    return this.events;
  }
}
```

 So fleshing this out and updating our view we get:

```typescript
class PostgresPostRepository implements PostRepository {
  constructor() {
    // establish the connection and set here
    this.client = ...
  }

  async save(post: Post) => {
    // perform all operations inside a transaction
    try {
      await this.client.query('BEGIN');

      // save the post object first
      const operation = post.id ? 'UPDATE' : 'INSERT';
      const postText = `${operation} INTO post(title, content, author) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)`;
      const postValues = [post.title, post.content, post.author]
      await this.client.query(postText, postValues);

      // now build the queries for all domain objects under it
      const eventPromises = post.getEvents().map(
        event => {
          // perform the appropriate query for this event
        }
      )
      await Promise.all(eventPromises);
      await client.query('COMMIT');
    } catch (e) {
      await this.client.query('ROLLBACK');
    } finally {
      this.client.release();
    }
  }

  // other methods left out!
}

// app.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.post('/api/comment/', (req, res) => {
  const postRepository = new PostgresPostRepository();
  const comment = new Comment(req.body.author, req.body.content);

  const post = postRepository.getPost(req.body.postId);
  post.addComment(comment);

  postRepository.save(post);

  res.send('""');
  res.status(201).end();
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App is listening at http://locahost${port}`)
});
```

Well, that's a lot more complicated isn't it? What have we achieved with this trade off?

1. We've made our domain object more easily testable, as any modifications to it are tracked in data, not in some external service.
2. We've decoupled our data layer entirely fromm our domain, meaning that we only need to look at the behaviour within the repository to understand what's going on in our system, and nowhere else.
3. This means that if we needed to change our data layer for some reason (moving to Aurora, or Redis, etc etc) we need only change the repository. As long as it implements the same interface we won't need to change any of code! (See [hexagonal architecture](/what-is/hexagonal-architecture/) for more.)

As with the application of any design pattern, there's always trade offs. If you're working with objects that don't lend themselves to aggregates then don't try to force them into one! For most applications however, the domain is sufficiently complex that doing so will be beneficial.
