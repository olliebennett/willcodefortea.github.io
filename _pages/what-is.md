I spend a lot of time _talking_. Probably more than I should and definitely more than people enjoy! Along the way however, I often get asked common programming questions and while most of the time I have a good answer to hand, it can be useful to have a record of those as well as a good opportunity to make sure what I'm talking about is correct.. ðŸ‘€
